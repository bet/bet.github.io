<h2>Bennett Todd</h2>
<HR>


<b>Bennett Todd</b>  is a systems and security analyst in the USA, and has worked with Wall St. firms since 1991. Before that he was a systems administrator at Duke University Medical Center, after getting a BSEE at Duke School of Engineering. Bennett has designed and created many security policies and firewalls, for both industry and for ISPs, and has had some excellent computer security audits - and, he gracefully admits, some of the other sort.<p>
